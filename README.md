## NUMTdumper: let's dump those NUMTs!

### Overview

NUMTdumper analyses a set of amplicons derived through metabarcoding of a codus locus to determine putative NUMT and other erroneous sequences based on relative read abundance thresholds within libraries, phylogenetic clades and/or taxonomic groupings.
